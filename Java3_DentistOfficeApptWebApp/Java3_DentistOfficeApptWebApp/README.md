This project is an Enterprise Application that may be used by a Dentist Office Patient or one of the Dentists themselves. 
The project takes information from an instructor-provided database and allows Patients to login, View/Change their information, and schedule an appointment if they did not have one prior.
The Dentists also login, View/Change their information, and view their upcomming appointments with patients.
